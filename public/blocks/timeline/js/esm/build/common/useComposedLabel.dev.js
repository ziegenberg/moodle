/**
 * Accessible name for a dropdown toggle that shows its current selection.
 *
 * The name has to contain the visible selection so that it can be spoken by voice control
 * (WCAG 2.5.3), but building it by placing the selection next to a second string leaves the
 * assembled phrase untranslatable: a translator sees each half on its own, with no context and no
 * way to change the order the two appear in. So the whole phrase is one string taking the
 * selection as {$a}, in the manner of core's monthprevwithname.
